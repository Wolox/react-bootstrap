## Deploy

`npm run deploy environment`

Where _environment_ must match with the current branch and _environment_ must have a .env file and a property in the aws.js configuration.

Valid environments are _development_, _stage_ and _master_

#### Example

- `.env.development` exists

Then, run `npm run deploy development`
